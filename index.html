I am a transfer student from Middlesex College with an Associate's Degree in Computer Information Systems. Currently, I am a Senior attending Kean University majoring in Information Technology with a Cybersecurity Option.My interest has always been centered around technology. I was inspired by my maternal family who are Kean Alumni and I am now the third generation to attend Kean. This year, I am focusing on applying for internships and will utilize the knowledge I am learning and apply it to my future employment. I am proud that my hard work and commitment to my studies are moving me closer to my educational goals. I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2024 with a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology-Cybersecurity Option and obtain a position as a Cybersecurity Analyst
